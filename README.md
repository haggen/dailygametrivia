# Daily Game Trivia

The **Daily Game Trivia** is an open-source and free to play browser game where you have to figure out the secret games of the day based on given hints such as year of release, genre, player's perspective, and more. Inspired by [gamedle.wtf](https://gamedle.wtf).

Game information is imported from [Twitch's IGDB](https://www.igdb.com).

## Development

The **Daily Game Trivia** is a React application built using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

To start clone the repository and run:

```sh
npm start
```

This will install dependencies, copy the `pre-commit` hook and spin up a development server.

### Database

The database is loaded staticly from `src/database.json`. This file is generated by the `import` script but requires a valid [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) client ID and secret.

```sh
CLIENT_ID=... CLIENT_SECRET=... npm run import
```

### Static analysis

We use ESLint, Prettier and TypeScript to maintain code quality.

You can apply fixes with:

```sh
npm run fix
```

And run tpye checking with:

```sh
npm run typecheck
```

It'll also run automatically before commits with the `scripts/pre-commit` hook.

### Deployment

Build the production bundle by running:

```sh
npm run build
```
