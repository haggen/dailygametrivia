# Daily Game Trivia

The **Daily Game Trivia** is an open-source and public browser game where you have to find out the secret game based on hints such as year of release, genre, player's perspective and more. Inspired by [gamedle.wtf](https://gamedle.wtf).

Game information is imported from [Twitch's IGDB](https://www.igdb.com).

## Development

The **Daily Game Trivia** is a React application built using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

To start clone the repository and run:

```sh
npm start
```

This will install dependencies, copy the `pre-commit` hook and spin up a development server.

### Database

The database is loaded staticly from `src/database.json`. This file is generated by the `import` script but requires a valid [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) client ID and secret.

```sh
CLIENT_ID=... CLIENT_SECRET=... npm run import
```

### Static analysis

We use ESLint, Prettier and TypeScript to maintain code quality.

```sh
npm run format -- --write
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Deployment

Build the production bundle by running:

```sh
npm run build
```
